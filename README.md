# Factor-Investing-Framework

A factor investing framework is a systematic approach to investment management where you build and manage portfolios based on certain factorsâ€”specific characteristics of securities that can explain their risk and return patterns over time. 

 The Core Idea
 -------

 Factor investing bets that certain characteristics (factors) systematically outperform over time.
 ----

So, instead of just picking stocks based on themes or gut feeling, you build a rules-based portfolio focusing on exposure to factors that have historically delivered excess returns.
